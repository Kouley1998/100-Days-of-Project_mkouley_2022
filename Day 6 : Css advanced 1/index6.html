        I practice much more a bit about Python Project even though that its a different 
        Projects. The Reason behind is only about time management and also school duty.

        the thgieories then going get my hand dirty in coding together mixing with HTML ;

        Day 4
       </h1> 
       <p>
        In day 4, a good basic knowledge and experience are the most important topic I am going work on it. 
        Tha say, since yesterday I found a nice website to practice my skills, which it is giving a challenge to do and improving my skills. 
        I am going only to focus on a very small task in order to understand the basics concepts and syntax.
