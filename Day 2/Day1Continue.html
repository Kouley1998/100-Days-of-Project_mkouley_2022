        Day 2 
    </h1>

    <p>
        I practice much more a bit about Python Project even though that its a different 
        Projects. The Reason behind is only about time management and also school duty. 
        <strong> I believe that from day 3 and On I will focus on only the Roadmaps I did </strong>
